PRACTICAL NO. 8

Aim: Configure NIS in order to share user accounts in your local network.

Theory: 
Network Information Services (NIS) enables you to create user accounts that can be shared across all systems on your network. 

The user account is created only on the NIS server. 

NIS clients download the necessary username and password data from the NIS server to verify each user login.

An advantage of NIS is that users need to change their passwords on the NIS server only, instead of every system on the network.

This makes NIS popular in computer training labs, distributed software development projects or any other situation where 
groups of people have to share many different computers.

Commands:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install nis
sudo nano /etc/default/nis
NISSERVER= master NISCLIENT=false
sudo cp /etc/default/nis  /etc/default/<filename>
ip a
sudo nano /etc/ypserv.securenets
subnetmask     ip address
sudo /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -m
which gmake
sudo apt-get install make (And Repeat Step 10)
sudo systemctl restart rpcbind nis
sudo systemctl status rpcbind
sudo nano/etc/hosts
ipaddress       server-name
sudo nano /etc/yp.conf
Domain domain-name  server server-host name
sudo nano /etc/nsswitch.conf
